# Love Pop

This is a simple web app that simulates orders for cards and visually shows those
cards, and their parts, progressively getting created. From getting the paper from
the storeroom to mailing the order out.

## Running

Execute the packaged jar file with

`java -jar love_pop.jar`

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser

Go to the orders page of the app and click the `Add Order` button.

That's it.

## Developing
Ensure you have the required dependencies then run the application

#### Prerequisites

`lein run`

In an new terminal, run:

`lein figwheel`

Then, go to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice (cough cough Chrome cough)
